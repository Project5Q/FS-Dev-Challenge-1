# Project5Q Challenge 1

Project5Q is the brain-child of some of the brightest minds in the industry. We believe that bored employees make boring products. This is why we're coming up with exciting new ways of combining crazy and innovative technologies to create amazing apps. 

So you're feeling adventurous, eh?

Complete the following challenge in as little time as possible and you might be on your way to becoming one of our elite developers.

## Instructions

* Fork this repo.
* Add a plain text file with your contact information and make that your first commit. Include full name, email, and skype user name. Optional: Linked-in link, Twitter handle, link to personal website.
* Create a **Fizz Buzz** app using [Clojure](http://clojure.org/getting_started)
* Set up an **HTTP** server which we can easily start, on port 8080, using the tools of your choice.
* Have it so that when we load up `localhost:8080` on our browser we see the result of your **Fizz Buzz** Clojure app, using **AJAX**.
* Once all of the above is ready, create a pull request to this repo with only a number as the comment; the number representing on a scale from 1 to 10, honestly, how hard you found this challenge. (1 being "super easy" and 10 being "hardest challenge ever")

## What we will evaluate

* How easy you make it for us to start up your app and HTTP server
* Good coding practices
