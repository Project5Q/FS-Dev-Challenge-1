# Project5Q Challenge 1

Project5Q is the brain-child of some of the brightest minds in the industry. We believe that bored employees make boring products. This is why we're coming up with exciting new ways of combining crazy and innovative technologies to create amazing apps. 

So you're feeling adventurous, eh?

Complete the following challenge in as little time as possible and you might be on your way to becoming one of our elite developers.

## Instructions

This application should be deployed in Heroku by Friday 4 pm CR time.

The Bitcoin market program will consist of following main components:

* A function that retrieves the current Bitcoin price from a market [it could any market, BitStamp could be one, just pick one].
* A scheduler that polls the preceding function at a predefined interval.
* A display function responsible for updating the screen with the Bitcoin price of that market.
* A display function responsible for updating the screen with the rolling average of the past five Bitcoin prices.

From a functional point of view, is that simple.

The challenge come from the following restriction: Javascript callback functions are forbidden. Instead, you will have to use the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS for managing any kind of event.

## What we will evaluate

* How easy you make it for us to start up your app and HTTP server
* Good coding practices
* Your commit log
